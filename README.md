# Linear Regression with Gradient Descent from Scratch
An implementation of Univariate and Multivariate Linear Regression from scratch using only NumPy, showcasing my strong grasp of Machine Learning fundamentals, Gradient Descent optimization, and Python programming. The models efficiently learn parameters using batch gradient descent, iteratively minimizing error to make accurate predictions.
